Understanding Your Dental Benefits Plan 
 
The Preferred Dentist Program is designed to provide the dental coverage you need with the features you want. Like the freedom to 
visit the dentist of your choice – in or out of the network. .

If you receive in-network services, you will be responsible for any applicable deductibles, cost sharing, negotiated charges after 
benefit maximums are met, and costs for non-covered services.  If you receive out-of-network services, you will be responsible for any 
applicable deductibles, cost sharing, charges in excess of the benefit maximum, charges in excess of the negotiated fee schedule 
amount or R&C Fee, and charges for non-covered services.

 
Plan benefits are based on the percentage of the 
negotiated fee – the fee that participating dentists have 
agreed to accept as payment in full for covered services, 
subject to any deductibles, copayments, cost sharing and 
benefit maximums.  Negotiated fees are subject to change.

*Alternate Benefits: Where two or more professionally acceptable dental treatments for a dental condition exist, reimbursement is based on the 
least costly treatment alternative. If you and your dentist have agreed on a treatment that is more costly than the treatment upon which the plan 
benefit is based, you will be responsible for any additional payment responsibility.  To avoid any misunderstandings, we suggest you discuss 
treatment options with your dentist before services are rendered, and obtain a pretreatment estimate of benefits prior to receiving certain high 
cost services such as crowns, bridges or dentures. You and your dentist will each receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) outlining the services 
provided, your plan’s reimbursement for those services, and your out-of-pocket expense. Actual payments may vary from the pretreatment 
estimate depending upon annual maximums, plan frequency limits, deductibles and other limits applicable at time of payment. 
 
The service categories and plan limitations shown above represent an overview of your Plan of Benefits. This document presents many services 
within each category, but is not a complete description of the Plan.  Please see your Plan description/Insurance certificate for complete details.  In 
the event of a conflict with this summary, the terms of your insurance certificate will govern.

Common Questions … Important Answers
 
Who is a participating dentist? 
A participating, or network, dentist is a general dentist or specialist who has agreed to accept negotiated fees as payment in 
full for covered services provided to plan members, subject to any deductibles, copayments, cost sharing and benefit 
maximums. Negotiated fees typically range from 30-45% below the average fees charged in a dentist’s community for the 
same or substantially similar services.*  
 
In addition to the standard MetLife network, your employer may provide you with access to a select network of dental 
providers that may be unique to your employer’s dental program. When visiting these providers, you may receive a better 
benefit, have lower out-of-pocket costs and/or have access to care at facilities at your worksite. Please sign into MyBenefits for 
more details. 
 
* Based on internal analysis by MetLife. Negotiated fees refer to the fees that participating dentists have agreed to accept as payment in full for covered services, subject to any copayments, 
deductibles, cost sharing and benefits maximums. Negotiated fees are subject to change. Savings from enrolling in a dental benefits plan will depend on various factors, including the cost of 
the plan, how often members visit a dentist and the cost of services rendered. Negotiated fees are subject to change. 
 
How do I find a participating dentist? 
There are thousands of general dentists and specialists to choose from nationwide --so you are sure to find one that meets your 
needs.  You can receive a list of these participating dentists online at www.metlife.com/dental or call 1-800-275-4638 to have a list 
faxed or mailed to you. 
 
What services are covered by my plan? 
Please see your Certificate of Insurance for a list of covered services. 
 
May I choose a non-participating dentist? 
Yes. You are always free to select the dentist of your choice. However, if you choose a non-participating (out-of-network) dentist, 
your out-of-pocket costs may be greater than your out-of-pocket costs when visiting an in-network dentist. 
 
Can my dentist apply for participation in the network? 
Yes. If your current dentist does not participate in the network and you would like to encourage him or her to apply, ask your 
dentist to visit www.metdental.com, or call 1-866-PDP-NTWK for an application.* The website and phone number are for use 
by dental professionals only. 
 
* Due to contractual requirements, MetLife is prevented from soliciting certain providers. 
 
How are claims processed?  
Dentists may submit your claims for you which means you have little or no paperwork. You can track your claims online and even 
receive email alerts when a claim has been processed. If you need a claim form, visit www.metlife.com/dental or request one by 
calling 1-800-275-4638. 
 
Can I get an estimate of what my out-of-pocket expenses will be before receiving a service? 
Yes. You can ask for a pretreatment estimate. Your general dentist or specialist usually sends MetLife a plan for your care and 
requests an estimate of benefits. The estimate helps you prepare for the cost of dental services. We recommend that you request 
a pre-treatment estimate for services in excess of $300. Simply have your dentist submit a request online at www.metdental.com 
or call 1-877-MET-DDS9. You and your dentist will receive a benefit estimate for most procedures while you are still in the office. 
Actual payments may vary depending upon plan maximums, deductibles, frequency limits and other conditions at time of payment. 
 
Can MetLife help me find a dentist outside of the U.S. if I am traveling? 
Yes. Through international dental travel assistance services* you can obtain a referral to a local dentist by calling +1-312-356-5970 
(collect) when outside the U.S. to receive immediate care until you can see your dentist. Coverage will be considered under your 
out-of-network benefits.** Please remember to hold on to all receipts to submit a dental claim. 
 
*International Dental Travel Assistance services are administered by AXA Assistance USA, Inc. (AXA Assistance). AXA Assistance provides dental referral services only.  AXA Assistance is not 
affiliated with MetLife and any of its affiliates, and the services they provide are separate and apart from the benefits provided by MetLife. Referral services are not available in all locations. 
** Refer to your Certificate of Insurance for your out-of-network dental coverage. 
 
How does MetLife coordinate benefits with other insurance plans? 
Coordination of benefits provisions in dental benefits plans are a set of rules that are followed when a patient is covered by 
more than one dental benefits plan. These rules determine the order in which the plans will pay benefits. If the MetLife dental 
benefit plan is primary, MetLife will pay the full amount of benefits that would normally be available under the plan. If the 
MetLife dental benefit plan is secondary, most coordination of benefits provisions require MetLife to determine benefits after 
benefits have been determined under the primary plan. The amount of benefits payable by MetLife may be reduced due to the 
benefits paid under the primary plan. 
 
Do I need an ID card?

No, You do not need to present an ID card to confirm that you are eligible.  You should notify your dentist that you are enrolled 
in a MetLife Dental Plan.  Your dentist can easily verify information about your coverage through a toll-free automated 
Computer Voice Response system. 
 
Do my dependents have to visit the same dentist that I select? 
No. You and your dependents each have the freedom to choose any dentist. 
 
If I do not enroll during my initial enrollment period can I still purchase Dental Insurance at a later date? 
Yes, employees who do not elect coverage during enrollment period may still elect coverage later.  Dental coverage would be 
subject to the following waiting periods.

 
No waiting period on Preventive Services 
 
6 months on Basic Restorative (Fillings) 
 
12 months on all other Basic Services 
 
24 months on Major Services 
 
24 months on Orthodontia Services (if applicable) 
 
Group dental insurance policies featuring the Preferred Dentist Program are underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 
New York, NY 10166. 
 
Like most group benefits programs, MetLife group benefits programs contain certain exclusions, waiting periods, reductions and 
terms for keeping them in force.  The certificate of insurance sets forth the plan terms and provisions, including the exclusions and 
limitations.
