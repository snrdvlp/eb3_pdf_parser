Combined Deductible
In-network deductibles for basic and major procedures are combined. Non-network deductibles

Combined Maximums
Maximums for preventive, basic, and major procedures are combined. In-network Calendar year
maximums are $2,000 per person. Non-network Calendar year maximums are $2,000 per
person.

Prevailing Charge
When using non-network providers, you pay any amount over the allowable charge.

Maximum Accumulation
This allows for a portion of unused maximum benefit to carry over to next year's maximum
benefit amount. To qualify, you must have had a dental service performed within the Calendar
year and used less than the maximum threshold. The threshold is equal to the lesser of 50% of
the maximum benefit or $1000. If qualification is met, 50% of the threshold is carried over to
next year's maximum benefit. Individuals with fourth quarter effectives will start qualifying for
rollover at the beginning of the next calendar year. You can accumulate no more than four
times the carry over amount. The entire accumulation amount will be forfeited if no dental
service is submitted within a calendar year.
