Other Important Information

This Aetna Dental® Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) benefits summary is provided by Aetna Life Insurance  
Company for some of the more frequently performed dental procedures.  
Under the Dental Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan, you may choose at the time of service either a  PPO  
participating dentist or any nonparticipating dentist. With the PPO plan, savings are possible because the participating  
dentists have agreed to provide care for covered services at negotiated rates.  Non-participating benefits are subject to  
recognized charge limits.

This policy DOES NOT include coverage of pediatric dental services as required under federal law. Coverage of pediatric  
dental services is available for purchase in the State of Colorado, and can be purchased as a stand-alone plan, or as a  
covered benefit in another health plan. Please contact your insurance carrier, agent, or Connect for Health Colorado to  
purchase either a plan that includes pediatric dental coverage, or an Exchange-qualified stand-alone dental plan that  
includes pediatric dental coverage.

PPP Prev/Basic 90th

Dental Benefits Summary

The replacement of; addition to; or modification of:  existing dentures; crowns; casts or processed restorations; removable  
denture; fixed bridgework; or other prosthetic services is covered only if one of the following terms is met:

The replacement or addition of teeth is required to replace one or more teeth extracted after the existing denture or 
bridgework was installed.  This coverage must have been in force for the covered person when the extraction took place.

The existing denture, crown; cast or processed restoration, removable denture, bridgework, or other prosthetic service  
cannot be made serviceable, and was installed at least 8 years before its replacement.

The existing denture is an immediate temporary one to replace one or more natural teeth extracted while the person is  
covered, and cannot be made permanent, and replacement by a permanent denture is required.  The replacement must take  
place within 12 months from the date of initial installation of the immediate temporary denture.

The extraction of a third molar does not qualify. Any such appliance or fixed bridge must include the replacement of an  
extracted tooth or teeth.

Tooth Missing But Not Replaced Rule

Coverage for the first installation of removable dentures;  fixed bridgework and other prosthetic services is subject to the  
requirements that such  removable dentures; fixed bridgework and other prosthetic services are (i) needed to replace one or  
more natural teeth that were removed while this policy was in force for the covered person; and (ii) are not abutments to a  
partial denture; removable bridge; or fixed bridge installed during the prior 8 years.

Alternate Treatment Rule : If more than one service can be used to treat a covered person’s dental condition, Aetna may  
decide to authorize coverage only for a less costly covered service provided that all of the following terms are met: 
    (a)  the service must be listed on the Dental Care Schedule; 
    (b)  the service selected must be deemed by the dental profession to be an appropriate method of treatment; and 
    (c) the service selected must meet broadly accepted national standards of dental practice.

If treatment is being given by a participating dental provider and the covered person asks for a more costly covered service  
than that for which coverage is approved, the specific copayment for such service will consist of:

(a)  the copayment for the approved less costly service; plus

(b)  the difference in cost between the approved less costly service and the more costly covered service.
