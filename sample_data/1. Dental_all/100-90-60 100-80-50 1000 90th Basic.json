  "Out of Network Explanation": "Out-of-network benefits are payable for services rendered by a dentist who is not a participating provider. The Reasonable and Customary charge is based on the lowest of: \n• the dentist’s actual charge (the 'Actual Charge'), \n• the dentist’s usual charge for the same or similar services (the 'Usual Charge') or \n• the usual charge of most dentists in the same geographic area for the same or similar services as determined by MetLife (the 'Customary Charge'). For your plan, the Customary Charge is based on the 90th percentile. Services must be necessary in terms of generally accepted dental standards.",
