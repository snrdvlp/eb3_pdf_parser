maximums are $1,000 per person. Non-network Calendar year maximums are $1,000 per
person.

Scheduled/MAC Design
Claim payments for both in-network and non-network services are based on the provider fee
schedule amounts.

Maximum Accumulation
This allows for a portion of unused maximum benefit to carry over to next year's maximum
benefit amount. To qualify, you must have had a dental service performed within the Calendar
year and used less than the maximum threshold. The threshold is equal to the lesser of 50% of
the maximum benefit or $1000. If qualification is met, 50% of the threshold is carried over to
next year's maximum benefit. Individuals with fourth quarter effectives will start qualifying for
rollover at the beginning of the next calendar year. You can accumulate no more than four
times the carry over amount. The entire accumulation amount will be forfeited if no dental
service is submitted within a calendar year.

Limitations & Exclusions

Missing Tooth
Benefits for the initial placement of bridges, partials and dentures are not covered if those teeth
were missing prior to becoming insured under the Principal Life policy. When the policy
replaces coverage under a prior plan, continuous coverage under the prior plan may be
applied to the missing tooth provision requirement.

Orthodontia
If there is orthodontia (ortho) treatment in progress on the coverage effective date and you are
covered under any prior group coverage for ortho, there will be immediate coverage for
treatment if proof is submitted that shows:
1) The lifetime maximum under any prior group coverage has not been exceeded,
2) Ortho treatment was started and bands or appliances were inserted while insured under
any prior group coverage, and
3) Ortho treatment has been continued while insured under this policy.

Principal Life will credit payments made by the prior carrier toward the Principal Life lifetime
ortho payment limit.

You will not be covered if ortho treatment is in progress prior to the effective date with
Principal Life and you are not covered under any prior group coverage for ortho.

Other Limitations
There are additional limitations to your coverage. A complete list is included in your booklet.

Combined Maximums
Maximums for preventive, basic, and major procedures are combined. In-network Calendar year
maximums are $2,500 per person. Non-network Calendar year maximums are $2,500 per

Prevailing Charge
When using non-network providers, you pay any amount over the allowable charge.

Maximum Accumulation
This allows for a portion of unused maximum benefit to carry over to next year's maximum
benefit amount. To qualify, you must have had a dental service performed within the Calendar
year and used less than the maximum threshold. The threshold is equal to the lesser of 50% of
the maximum benefit or $1000. If qualification is met, 50% of the threshold is carried over to
next year's maximum benefit. Individuals with fourth quarter effectives will start qualifying for
rollover at the beginning of the next calendar year. You can accumulate no more than four
times the carry over amount. The entire accumulation amount will be forfeited if no dental
service is submitted within a calendar year.
